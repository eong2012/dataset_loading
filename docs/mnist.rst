MNIST
=====

As this is a very commonly used dataset, there is a utility function to help
load it in:

.. automodule:: dataset_loading.mnist
    :members: get_mnist_queues
    :noindex:

This is identical to the CIFAR function. To check out usage instructions, have
a look `there`__. **Note that the return size for MNIST will be 28x28x1**.
